# Decor Application

This is a simple web-based decor slide application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application presents different decor styles to the user in an attractive sliding interface.

## Overview

The application works as a slide show, where each slide represents a unique decor style. Slides are responsive to user click events. Once a slide is clicked, it expands to offer a more detailed view, while the other slides contract.

The application also utilizes CSS transitions to provide a smooth user experience.

## Files

The application consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: This is the main page of the application, where decor styles are displayed as individual slides. Each slide includes a decor style name and a background image representing the style.

2. `styles.css`: This file contains the styling for the application, including the layout of the slides, the hover effects for interactive elements, and transitions for active states.

3. `app.js`: This is the main logic of the application. It handles the user interactions with the slides, including activating and deactivating the slides upon user clicks.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to start the application.
2. Each slide represents a decor style. Click on a slide to expand it and get a detailed view of the decor style.
3. Click again on the expanded slide to contract it back to its original state.
